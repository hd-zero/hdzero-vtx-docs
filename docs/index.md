## What is HDZero?

**PUSH YOUR SKILLS TO THE LIMIT**

HDZero offers industry-leading low latency, giving you more time to react and the best possible chance of hitting that next gap. With its smooth, consistent FPV video feed, you'll experience the same locked-in feeling you get with analog video–but with the clarity of HD.

**MAKE IT AN EVENT**

HDZero supports the standard 5.8ghz video channels, meaning you can have up to 8 simultaneous pilots flying either full-quality HDZero or analog video. When you're ready to take a break and spectate, you can tune in to any channel and view the pilot's feed with no loss of quality, giving you the same feeling of being in the air yourself.

**UPGRADE YOUR FLEET**

From 1S whoops to long-range wings, HDZero offers a variety of VTX and camera options to suit every build. You may even be able to use the gear you already have–the HDZero receiver will work with any FPV goggle with an HDMI input. HDZero can grow with your needs and fit perfectly into your preferred FPV craft.

**RAPIDLY EVOLVING SYSTEM**

HDZero is rapidly evolving. Please always use the latest firmware that is located at  [www.hd-zero.com/document](http://www.hd-zero.com/document).
