However, it is not a mechanically strong connector. Treat it as if it\u2019s made of glass. Here are notes for installing and uninstalling an antenna: Never run a cable from the UFL connector straight off the side of a board. Instead, run the antenna cable towards the middle of the board, and secure it in one of the following ways: Hot glue or E6000 glue Avoid using glue on top of the hot components on the board. Preferably, apply glue to the side of the board where the cable leaves the top of the board. Kapton tape to secure it to the surface of the VTX Zip tie it to a nearby standoff Unless you need maximum RF performance or minimum weight, consider a UFL->SMA pigtail for larger builds. This allows you to thoroughly secure the SMA connector to your quad to prevent movement of the antenna cable. When removing the antenna, go very slowly and pull gently on the antenna so that one side of the UFL slides off first. There are tools designed to remove/insert UFL connectors from their sockets, which can help avoid damage to the UFL connector or socket. Please visit the following link for more information: https://www.facebook.com/groups/hdzero/permalink/448657693828864/ Powering the VTX: BEC or VBAT Using a battery eliminator circuit (BEC) is highly recommended to avoid voltage spikes, which can damage the VTX. Although you can power the VTX directly from the battery (VBAT), a BEC will provide more consistent power and will help absorb any voltage spikes, protecting your VTX from over-voltage conditions. It is important to select a BEC that provides voltage that is within the range of what the VTX accepts, and that is capable of supplying enough current to power the VTX. Whether you are using a BEC that is built into your flight controller or a standalone BEC, be sure to check its voltage and current ratings and compare them to the required voltage and current for your VTX. All the FCs that include an integrated BEC for DJI VTXes should also work for HDZero VTXes. To summarize: All HDZero VTXes, except Freestyle Batch 2 VTX or later, do not support 6S VBAT. Check your FC specs to see if you can run your VTX from the FC\u2019s BEC; If not, you could run the VTX from a suitable standalone BEC; If not, solder a capacitor between the +V and Ground on the VTX. Running on VBAT is always the last choice due to the challenging voltage environment in a quad. Mounting Considerations It is very important to keep some distance between the VTX and ESC/FC boards for the following reasons: The RF portion of VTX is vulnerable to electronic noise caused by ESC/motors; The RF signal can be bounced back from surfaces of boards or carbon fiber plate, and fed back to the power amplifier in the VTX. This will deteriorate the RF signal integrity and could damage the amplifier. To avoid these concerns, follow this guidance for mounting the VTX: If the VTX is mounted on the top of the stack, please keep 5mm distance from the top carbon fiber plate. Avoid mounting the VTX in the middle of the stack. If the VTX is mounted on the bottom of the stack, the VTX needs to be upside down (U.FL socket faces down) and needs to have a minimum of 5mm distance from the bottom carbon fiber plate. Targets HDZero Whoop video Transmitter (EOL) The HDZero Whoop VTX is a digital HD 720p 60fps video transmitter capable of delivering up to 200mw on 5.8GHz. The power input range is 7V \u2013 17V (2S \u2013 4S). Due to the small clearance of mounting holes, make sure the mounting nuts or gummies will not overlap into the small components around the holes. This VTX is designed for low-speed whoop application. Compared to the other HDZero VTXes, it is more vulnerable to be damaged by crash due to: (1) the UFL connector is easily peeled off due to no antenna retention, and (2) it is not easy for soft mounting. Though the VTX can be mounted on a racing and other high-speed quad, it is highly recommended to consider HDZero Race (V1 or V2) for such application. This VTX does not support SmartAudio or Tramp. Notes: Read first: General Consideration for VTX installation Soft mount Pay extra attention not to damage the small components when trying to remove the serrate corner HDZero Whoop Lite Video Transmitter The HDZero Whoop lite VTX is a digital HD 720p 60fps video transmitter capable of delivering up to 200mw on 5.8GHz. The power input range is 2.8V \u2013 13V (1S-3S). This VTX does not have reserve polarity protection circuit, it will be permanently damaged if voltage input is reservedly connected. This is number one failure cause. When it is powered by a 5V pad of FC/BEC, make sure that 5V has 1.5A current output. When it is powered by an 1S battery directly, note that a rapid throttle up may cause voltage drop below to 2.8V instantly, and that will cause video drop. There is no need for an external capacitor when it connects with FC/BEC or 1S battery. However, it is strongly suggested to put on capacitor when powered by a 3S battery. This VTX has protection cases mounted on both sides. These metal cases are grounded, and to provide protection from crash. They can be removed for tiny whoop quad which cares about every added gram. This VTX includes M3/M2 gummies for soft mounting, and zip ties for antenna retention. Though the VTX can be mounted on a racing and other high-speed quad, it is highly recommended to consider HDZero Race (V1 or V2) for such application.

Notes: Read first: General Consideration for VTX installation Make sure to use a wider top plate to fully c over this VTX for protection. HDZero Race V3 Video Transmitter Designed for FPV racing, the HDZero Race V3 VTX is our 3rd generation digital video transmitter. With a voltage range starting at 4V, it can be powered by the 5V 1.5A regulator of most FC's or up to 12V for FC's that include a HD VTX plug. It is small (28x32x5mm) and light (5.5 grams). With a width of only 28mm, the VTX is now a similar width to many FC's, which improves durability and reduces weight. The antenna is securely attached with a metal bar and screws. No soldering needed \u2013 just plug the wire harness into a compatible HD-ready FC. The HDZero Race V3 VTX is designed with durability in mind, rather than weight. It is made with a 1.6mm thick PCB, in comparison to the 1.0mm PCB used in the Whoop lite VTX. Moreover, it uses more large package size components for stability consideration. For the smaller components, an additional glue coating is applied to increase crash protection. The HDZero Race V3 VTX offers high-quality video in 540p90, 720p60 and 1080p30 resolutions with 25/200mW switchable power on 5.8GHz.

The 1st batch of Freestyle V1 VTX, supports 2S-4S, A BEC supporting 2S-6S is included. The 2nd batch and later, supports 2S-6S, and the BEC is not included. Important Notes: Do not directly power this VTX with a 5S/6S battery for the 1st batch. Use 2S-4S VBAT, or included BEC, or FC with built-in BEC The Freestyle VTX consumes up to 15W. If it is connected with FC that has a built-in BEC output, make sure the BEC can provide enough current. For example, if the BEC provides 10V, it needs a minimum of 1.5A current output. Removing the heat sink is not recommended because it is part of the design. Rotate the antenna as shown above before detaching it to reduce the risk of peeling off the UFL connector. HDZero Freestyle V2 Video Transmitter The HDZero Freestyle V2 VTX is our 2nd generation 5.8GHz digital video transmitter which can be fitted into most 3-5-inch HD drones. All sockets are well protected by the CNC case that provides durability, RF shielding and improved signal integrity. A wire harness is included for solderless connection for power and MSP UART port.

Re-update firmware Update to the latest version. Make sure the firmware types matches your VTX. 2. Check the red and blue LED status 1). The red LED is off or unstable The red light is directly driven by the system's 5V power supply. If the red light is not lit stably, it is usually because there is a problem with the power supply. Make sure the voltage and maximum current of the power supply are within the specifications. Check if any components are cracked. There may be a fault with your VTX's power supply system, you can use a multimeter to measure the voltage test pad to verify it if you have the hardware knowledge. 2). The blue LED never lights up Your VTX 5680 chip starts correctly. When the 5680 is initializing, it will first configure the blue LED to be on to indicate that the 5680 mcu has started. If you plug in the Quad battery while the FC is connected to the PC, the VTX may fail to boot although this does not happen often. There may be a fault with your VTX's power supply system, you can use a multimeter to measure the voltage test power to verify it if you have the hardware knowledge. 3). The blue light turns off after a few seconds after powering on At the end of VTX initialization, if the camera is not detected, the blue light will go out. In particular, the foxeer digisight v3 camera cannot be detected but this does not affect the VTX output RF. Replace other camera or mipi cable. Check whether the pins of the mipi socket are intact and ensure that the mipi cable is fastened. Check whether the pins of the 5680 chip are clean. 4). The blue LED stays on Replace other camera or mipi cable. Check whether the pins of the mipi socket are intact and ensure that the mipi cable is fastened. Check whether the pins of the 5680 chip are clean. Use the colorbar firmware to test to make sure the RF part works properly. 5). The blue LED flash as 2Hz Your VTX may be in 0mw mode. You can exit using the following methods. Quad + VTX power on Connect Quad to betaflight configurator Enter vtx page, set power from 0mw to others 6).

Cross testing Replace the VTX, camera, and mipi cables respectively to identify where the problem lies. 5. Check power supply An unclean power supply may cause the camera to have the wrong color. Please use a DC stabilized voltage source for testing or use a battery for direct power supply. OSD is not display Description Solutions 1. Re-update firmware Update to the latest version. Make sure the firmware types matches your VTX. 2. Check hardware connections VTX TX connects to FC RX VTX RX connects to FC TX Do not connect VTX to the FC's soft serial port. Try other FC UART ports. 3. Check FC configuration 1). Set the function of the FC serial port occupied by VTX, save and restart. For Betaflight, you need to set uart peripheral to VTX(MSP+DISPLAYPORT). The picture below shows setting UART3 to OSD. For iNav, you need to set uart Peripheral to MSP DisplayPort . The picture below shows setting UART5 to OSD. 2). Unsupported OSD items There are some OSD items that require hardware support to actually be enabled, which depends on FC rather than VTX. For example, OSD items related to GPS can only be displayed when FC actually detects the GPS module. OSD display unstable Description OSD flashing OSD VTX channel/pwr display ?:?:? OSD refresh slowly Wrong OSD location Solutions 1. Re-update firmware Update to the latest version. Make sure the firmware types matches your VTX. 2. Reduce OSD items If too many OSD items are turned on, the carrying capacity of the uart may be exceeded, which may cause individual OSD items to be unable to be displayed. 3. Close SmartAudio It is normal for the OSD to flash when SmartAudio is configuring VTX. Please turn off SmartAudio if you don't need it. Snowflakes at close range Description Solutions 1. Re-update firmware Update to the latest version. Make sure the firmware types matches your VTX. 2. Check VTX configuration Make sure pit mode is off 3. Avoid RF interference There may be interference sources in the current channel. Switch to other channels. The RF power of the remote control tuner is too high. Make sure the turner is at least 20cm away from Goggle or VRX. When VTX and VRX or Goggle are too close (less than 1 meter), it is normal for a small amount of snowflakes to appear. 4. Build Quad Correctly Check whether the VTX antenna is installed securely. Try to make sure that the antenna is not blocked by the carbon fiber of the quad or the battery. Replace other antenna for VTX. The top of VTX should be at least 1cm away from the carbon fiber. Add filter capacitors to your Quad. 5. Check VTX hardware Check the front and back of the VTX to see if any components are cracked or falling off. Check whether the PA is damaged. For Freestyle V1 VTX, when the power is off, measure whether the two test points named 5V0 on the front are short-circuited to ground. If short-circuited, it means the PA is damaged. For Freestyle V2 VTX, If after powering on, the red light in the position shown below lights up, it indicates that the PA has been damaged. For other VTXes. Measure the voltage from test point PD to GND in the power-on state. Generally, when PD is less than 0.2V, the PA is considered to be working abnormally.

As an example: UART3 on picture below is used for VTX (MSP + Displayport). VTX Table You really don't need to care about it because VTX will automatically configure the vtx table of the FC. Stick Command Before using stick command, make sure that fc uart is set correctly. VTX Menu All HDZero VTXes have the following settings for its RF power level management. These settings can be changed using the VTX menu. CHANNEL All VTXes support R1-R8, E1, F1, F2 and F4 channels. You will get an additional 8 channels L1-L8 if you unlock the lowband. POWER The desired RF power level is selectable between 25mW, 200mW (and 500mW or MAX for certain VTXes). The actual RF power level depends on the following settings and FC status. LP_MODE OFF: The output RF power will be set to POWER setting. ON: If PIT_MODE is OFF and the quad is disarmed, the RF power level will be forced to 25mW regardless of POWER setting.The output RF power will be set to POWER setting when quad is armed. 1ST : If PIT_MODE is OFF, the RF power level will be forced to 25mW regardless of POWER setting when QUAD is power on, The output RF power will be set to POWER setting when QUAD is armed. Note that after first arm, the vtx will not enter lp mode again until vbat power is reset. PIT_MODE OFF: The output RF power will be set to POWER setting. P1MW: The output RF power will be 0.1mW (in order to not interfere with other pilots) in this mode. If the quad is armed, RF output power will be automatically set to the POWER within seconds. 0MW: There will be zero RF output in this mode. If quad is armed, RF output power will be automatically set to POWER within seconds. Note that after first arm, the vtx will not enter pit mode again until vbat power is reset. OFFSET_25MW It is to fine tune the RF output power to be exactly 25mW. The range is [-10:10], and step size is about 0.3dB per step. TEAM_RACE OFF: The RF power of VTXs after power-on is determined by other settings. MODE1: VTX RF remains off (0mW) after power-up, and exits 0mW under the following conditions: 1. Quad is armed. 2. Exit 0mw mode through stick command. 3. Configure VTX power to non-0mW through FC UART or SmartAudio. If the UART communication between VTX and FC is disconnected, VTX will turn off the RF until UART communication is restored and repower the VTX. MODE2 : VTX RF remains off(0mW) after power-up, and exits 0mW under the following conditions: 1. Quad is armed. 2. Exit 0mw mode through stick command. 3. Configure VTX power to non-0mW through FC. SHORTCUTS Two different stick commands are provided for switching or exiting 0mW. See the Stick Movement diagram for details. Note HDZero VTX will still become hot even on P1mW mode. It is better to keep VTX on 0mW when it will be idle for a while. Though the receiver will not have live video on this mode, it will come back as soon as the quad is armed. Use sticks shortcut to enter 0mW, and to exit 0mW mode. Smartaudio Protocol\uff08Not recommend\uff09 HDZero VTX can be controlled by FC using the TBS SmartAudio V2.1. In this case, the VTX will output RF power and channel commanded by FC directly. To avoid conflict, If SmartAudio is enabled, only OFFSET_25MW and SHORTCUTS are available in the VTX menu. Note: HDZero VTX outputs 0.1mW when SmartAudio PIT mode is ON. HDZero VTX does not support SmartAudio out range PIT mode. When HDZero Race VTX boots up, it will automatically detect the existence of a valid SmartAudio link with FC within 10 seconds. If the link exists, FC will fully control race VTX\u2019s RF output power and working frequency. You don't need to set up the vtx table manually for betaflight, VTX will set it up automatically via uart port. With SmartAudio, the user can change channel number and power level even when quad is in the air. Unlock RF POWER Limit HDZero Freestyle V1/V2 VTX is compliant with FCC 47 CFR 97.215(c). It is limited to 25mW/200mW out of the box, but it is capable of up to 1W if you have the required HAM radio license to use this power output. Download the special firmware from www.hd-zero.com/document to enable higher RF output modes. Here are the steps: Download firmware Unlock_FreestyleVTX.zip. Unzip it to the root directory of SD Card. Use the VRX to flash this firmware to the VTX. Power on the VTX, BLUE LED will flash 3 times after it is done. This step unlocks VTX. Power the VTX off. Unzip normal VTX firmware to the root directory of SD Card. Use the VRX to flash this firmware to the VTX. The higher RF output options will now be available. Please note once the VTX is unlocked, there is no need to unlock it again when there is newer firmware available. Unlock Low band The VTX low band needs to be unlocked before it can be used. Make sure your region allows low band before unlocking. To unlock low band for VTX: Here are the steps: Download Unlock_Lowband.zip from www.hd-zero.com/document . Unzip and flash as firmware update to your VTX. Power on VTX, BLUE LED flashes 5 times and then goes out, unlock completed. Flash the latest release firmware to your VTX.
